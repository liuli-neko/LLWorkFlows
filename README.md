# LLWorkFlows
> A project to try work flows <br/>
## Why do this
Simplifying the implementation of a program or project has always been a challenge, and many bigwigs have used their frameworks to provide a variety of answers. For example: <br/>
the famous UI frameworks such as Qt, Flutter, Node.Js, etc. There are also the widely used Chromium cores, all of which have decent performance and unmatched convenience. <br/>
the famous Game frameworks such as Godot Engine, Unreal Engine, unity engine, etc., have better performance and stronger animation support than simple UI frameworks, but they are also larger. And there is a higher cost of learning.<br/>
But now, I just need a stream processing framework developed in C++ to use the increasingly powerful CPUs & GPUs without having to analyze and account for the synchronization of different processes.<br/>
## What I want to do
我想要实现一个流计算框架，它应当具备如下的特点：
- 函数式可自定义节点。
- 可自行同步的安全的数据传递。
- 更充分的利用现有资源进行并行计算。
- 更完好的
